# FEATURES

* Standalone mode for editing DTDs;

* "Goto" menu for locating declarations within the current buffer;

* `dtd-etags` function for creating Emacs TAGS files for easy lookup
  across multiple files of any element, parameter entity, or
  notation's definition using Emacs's built-in tag-lookup functions;

* `dtd-grep` function for searching files that shares a file history
   with `dtd-etags` for easy searching of the same files with both
   functions;

* Specific font lock highlighting of declarations in XML DTDs, SGML
  DTDs, SGML Declarations, and System Declarations so that the
  important information stands out;

* XML-specific behaviour that, at user option, is triggered by
  automatic detection of the XML Declaration; 

* Functions for writing and editing element, attribute, internal
  parameter entity and external parameter entity declarations and
  comments to ease creating and keeping a consistent style; and

* Elements and parameter entity names referenced in declarations are
  stored in minibuffer history to minimise retyping in new
  declarations.

dtd-mode references `sgml-validate` for its validation function.  Use
with Lennart Staflin's `psgml` package is recommended.

Use with `resize-minibuffer-mode` is also recommended.

The "Goto" menu is only available if you have `imenu.el`.

dtd-mode was tested using NTEmacs 20.7.1.

# FORMATTING VARIABLES

dtd-mode uses many user-definable variables to control the formatting
of declarations, some of which are shown in the following examples:

                            dtd-comment-start-column    dtd-dtd-max-column
                            |                    dtd-comment-max-column  |
                            |                                         |  |
    <!--                    This is a comment                          -->

               dtd-element-name-column
               |            dtd-element-tag-ommission-column
               |            |   dtd-element-content-spec-start-column
               |            |   |dtd-element-content-spec-continuation-column
               |            |   ||                      dtd-dtd-max-column
               |            |   ||                                       |
    <!ELEMENT  element-tag  - - (insert, your, content, specification,
                                 here)                                   >

# BUG REPORTS/ENCHANCEMENTS

I would be glad to accept bug reports and/or enhancements.  Use
`dtd-submit-bug-report`.

# INSTALLATION

1. Unzip the distribution.

   This should extract the files listed in the manifest above.

   The files have DOS-style line breaks.  You may need to use "unzip
   -a" or "gunzip -a" to convert the line ends in the files to your
   local convention.

2. Copy the tdtd.el and tdtd-font.el files to somewhere on your emacs
   `load-path`; for example, your emacs site-lisp directory (e.g.,
   /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp).

   XEmacs users also need to make sure that they have imenu.el
   installed before they can use the "Goto" menu.

3. Byte compile tdtd.el and tdtd-font.el using M-x byte-compile-file
   and supplying the path name of each file.

   The provided makefile also has rules for byte-compiling the files.

   If you byte-compiled a previous version of tdtd.el and
   tdtd-font.el, then you must byte-compile the new files (or remove
   the old .elc files) so that autoload loads the correct versions.

   If you do not have imenu.el, you may receive a "assignment to free
   variable imenu-create-index-function" warning when you byte compile
   tdtd.el.  You will, however, be able to use the compiled tdtd.elc
   without error (and without the "Goto" menu).

   You do not need tdtd-font-maker.el or make-regexp.el in order to
   use tdtd.  They are provided in case you want to modify the
   font-lock regular expressions and remake tdtd-font.el.

4. Add the elisp code in dot_emacs to your .emacs file.

   Windows users that are not using a Unix-like shell (e.g. bash)
   should uncomment and use the definition of dtd-etags-regex-option
   in dot_emacs.

5. When you visit a file with an extension of .dtd, etc., dtd-mode
   will automatically be loaded.

6. You will probably want to install Lennart Staflin's "psgml" package
   to enable all features.


# MAKING tdtd-font.el

tdtd-font.el is created by tdtd-font-maker.el.  You should not need to
remake tdtd-font.el unless you have tinkered with the regular
expressions in tdtd-font-maker.el.

1. Load file `tdtd-font-maker.el`.

2. Execute `dtd-make-tdtd-font`.

   tdtd-font.el is created in the current directory.
